# Day 1
## Swift

### Time taken: 

30 minutes.

### Language Experience:

1 [See this link for explaination][https://github.com/aaomidi/Advent-of-Code-2017/blob/master/README.md]

### Lessons learned:

Swift is an okay language. It does some really stupid stuff, which honestly should be fixed.

`Character -> Int` shouldn't have to be `Char -> String -> Int`. Maybe I did something wrong, in which case I'd love if someone pointed it out to me!
